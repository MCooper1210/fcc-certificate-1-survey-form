This repository is for my first index.html file, which is the first certificate in the freeCodeCamp course. It is a simple survey form designed to teach very basic elemenets of HTML.

## Description

This survey is used to collect user data, covering concepts such as text inputs, dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes and text areas. As it was my first HTML index, I was unsure what topic to pick, so I randomly chose these. I apologise for the lack of a direction here.

## Contents

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the survey form.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing styles for the survey form.

## Technologies Used
